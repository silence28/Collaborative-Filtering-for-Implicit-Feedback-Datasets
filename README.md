# Collaborative-Filtering-for-Implicit-Feedback-Datasets

Collaborative filtering which is filtering information by using the recommendations of other people. It is based on the idea that people who agreed in their evaluation of certain items in the past are likely to agree again in the future.

There are different algorithms which can be used for the recommendation and in this tutorial I use the matrix factorization method. The jupyter notebook file ‘collaborative-filtering-for-implicit-feedback-datasets.ipynb’ explains the model and the same model can be deployed in Google Cloud which is implemented in ‘google-cloud-recommender’ folder.
